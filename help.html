        <h2>What is Join?</h2><br />
        <p><span class="color-lb">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by
            a
            group of
            dedicated students as
            part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
            <br>
            <br>
            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="color-lb">Join</span> leverages
            the principles of
            kanban to help
            users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important to note that <span class="color-lb">Join</span> is designed as an educational
            exercise and is not
            intended for
            extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot

        <h2>How to use it</h2><br />
        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="color-lb">Join</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Exploring the Board</h4>
                <p>When you log in to <span class="color-lb">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board
                    represents
                    your project and
                    contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Creating Contacts</h4>
                <p>In <span class="color-lb">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
                    to the
                    "Contacts" section,
                    click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can
                    be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Adding Cards</h4>
                <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
                    represent individual
                    tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                    task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Moving Cards</h4>
                <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board
                    by dragging
                    and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Deleting Cards</h4>
                <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete
                    it. Deleting a
                    card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards,
                    as
                    this action is irreversible.
                    Remember that using <span class="color-lb">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
                    updates from you and
                    your team to
                    ensure the board reflects the current state of your project. Have more questions about
                    <span class="color-lb">Join</span>?
